				<p class="projects-paragraph-hero">The technological landscape is in a constant state of flux. For those of us who choose development and design work as our chosen profession, it can feel like a never ending spiral of new technologies, new buzzwords, and new jargon are being tossed around daily. This information gap also feeds the stereotype that designers and developers don’t understand each other, which can lead to stifling creative output.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-hero">Open Source Magazine aims to demystify past and current development and design concepts, news, and history by creating an informed reader base that is up-to-date on the latest issues in the field. Open Source Magazine selects articles that will appeal and educate both front-end developers and designers, regardless of experience level, so that we may synergize our newfound understanding and knowledge and build something great together.</p>

				<h3 class="projects-h3-subheads" id="opportunity">The Opportunity</h3>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">The primary opportunity for Open Source is to create a technology magazine that focuses specifically on UI design and development. Currently, science and technology magazines exist, but tend to focus on pop-science or more on science than technology. A gap exists in the current market for a front-end development and design magazine in print. Multitudes of tutorials and think-pieces are being published daily online on the topics of UI design and development, but sifting thought these articles on your own can be tedious, and invendablely you will miss out on helpful articles.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">The secondary opportunity is to create a magazine that can bridge the gap between development and design.  A stigma persists in the technology space that developers and designers do not understand each other. Open Source can remedy this tension by curating articles that appeal to both developers and designers, that can be easily understood by both.</p>

			<div class="col">
				<h5 class="no-margin">Research and Interviews</h5>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Having previously worked in a development space, I knew I wanted to create a magazine that appealed to both development and design thinking. However, I was not sure if this topic was broad enough for a larger audience.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Over the summer, I met with my friends who work in both development and design and conducted in-person interviews, asking them what content would be relevant and interesting to them as readers. From those interviews, I was able to discern that virtual reality and augmented reality were popular topics as well as accessibility standards and application. With those subjects in mind, my next steps involved curated the articles for the magazine.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col">
				<h5 class="no-margin-1">Content Sourcing</h5>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">The next steps involved sourcing the articles, images, and advertisements that would be present in the magazine. Finding the content for the articles was fairly simple as I sourced articles from reputable sources online and found tutorials that were text heavy. Sourcing interviews was a surprisingly fun part of the process as I was able to learn about women in tech, and how their professional journeys unfolded. Lastly, I sourced images from high resolution photo sites like Unsplash and Pexels for the images throughout the magazine as well as tapping into archival advertisement photos saved from previous years projects.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col">
				<h5 class="no-margin-1">Personas</h5>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Now that my research and content sourcing was complete, it was time to synthesize findings from my research into my primary reader personas as well as map out the flatplan for the magazine. My personas reflect the varying experience, educational levels and occupations present in our readership.</p>

		<div class="row">

She is advanced with technology and needs to stay up-to-date with the latest trends in front-end development as well as increase her skills around design fundamentals, such as layout, color, and type.</p>

He needs reinforcement of basic design fundamentals as well as exposure to higher level tutorials and articles. He does not have an interest in development, but can see how it might be useful to know basic vocabulary for his future job. </p>

			<div class="col">
				<h5 class="no-margin-1">Flatplan</h5>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Now that the readership for the magazine was defined, I started work on the flatplan. The flatplan in a magazine provides a general outline of how the issue will be laid out. The flatplan can be as simple or detailed as the designer chooses. As a living document, the flatplan can be updated and changed as the design solution emerges. </p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">The flatplan for Open Source, demonstrates that full-page images are a design language commonly used throughout the magazine to create a sense of unity, while only adding advertisements as needed.</p>

			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col">
				<h5 class="no-margin-1">Layout and Typography</h5>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">With my flatplan defined, it was time to make decisions on layout and typography. For typography I settled on Open Sans for my body copy and Proxima Nova bold for my headers. I originally started with Fira Mono for the body copy but decided it was too condensed for reading, and applied it to captions instead.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">The primary layout system for the magazine utilizes full page images when introducing a new article, and breaks into smaller images for the inside spreads. Headers and text always appear next to the full page image at the start of each article. Full page pull quotes are applied for feature articles to break up the copy and add flavor to the article.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">The navigation system can be found in three places throughout the magazine. Page and article name appear persistently at the bottom of the page. At the beginning of each new article, top left navigation appears. The navigation system defines the article name, page number and article category, such as design history, development, tutorial and so on.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col">
				<h5 class="no-margin-1">Visual Design and Illustration</h5>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">The last step in my process was to explore how the magazine should look and feel. Initially, I was drawn to black and white, with neutral pinks and browns as accent colors. I tried applying this approach to my feature spreads, and found that the images I had previously sourced were not appropriate with a serious, futuristic, and masculine tone..</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">I took a step back and looked deeper at what my articles and images looked like. I noticed that all my sourced images used saturated colors, bold and eye-catching. I decided to explore that direction, pairing white with jewel-toned pinks, blues, yellows, and purples. This vivid color palette matched the articles in tone, and was adopted as the final primary color palette.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">With a new visual direction in mind, I still wanted my illustrations to reflect a tech-focused magazine. I decided to use a hexagon pattern across various spreads in the magazine to create visual interest, establish a distinct voice, and unite the articles across the magazine.</p>
