				<p class="projects-paragraph-hero">In the United States, birth control and emergency contraception access is dependent on location and local and federal legislation. Women who live in areas without reasonable access to a full-range of contraceptive services, reasonable access being one health clinic per 1,000 women, live in contraception deserts.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-hero">Contraceptive deserts primarily impact poorer and more conservative areas in the United States, and shift the burden of finding healthcare onto vulnerable populations. In many cases, women who live in contraception deserts are unable to take time off work to drive hours to the nearest health clinic, and many cannot justify the cost of a multi-mile trip for access to reproductive healthcare.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-hero">Under the Trump administration, contraception deserts are expected to rise, as the administration seeks to defund Title X. Title X are the only federally mandated funds dedicated towards helping low-income women receive access to birth control. Many of the remaining clinics near and in contraception deserts rely on Title X funding to remain open.</p>

				<h5 class="no-margin">Research and Interviews</h5>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">The first step in the process was to sit down and conduct in-person interviews. I met with two women who shared their experience and history with birth control. I posed questions about the quality of care from their physicians, which methods worked best/worse for them and why, and what their ideal system for obtaining birth control would be.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">One of the main takeaways from this process was birth control can be a process of trial and error. Both women expressed starting one method and having to switch due to side effects. This struck me as especially important, having access and communication with a doctor once you obtain your birth control and never feeling isolated around your health, felt important.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Other interesting takeaways included frustrations over not being heard by doctors, inappropriate comments from doctors and unclear communication of side-effects. See the quotes and comments from my interviews below.</p>

She is in a monogamous relationship, but lives in a contraception desert, with access to care being limited. She lives in a county where sex education is abrievated and is confused about birth control myths versus facts. She is uninsured, and cannot afford expensive birth control options.

She has been on the same birth control pill for almost a decade and is looking for a way to streamline her reproductive healthcare. She feels trealving to a doctors office wastes her time and money and is looking for a delivery service to replace her annual OB-GYN visit.

				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">With my new personas in hand, I sought to further align myself with their goals and pain points by creating empathy maps for the two primary personas, Whitney and Nikia.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">The main takeaway for Whitney was a sense of fear around a new process. Having limited exposure to birth control can be overwhelming and isolating, especially with a lack of parental support. Creating an experience that is unpretentious and direct felt important for Whitney’s journey.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">The main takeaway for Nikia involved efficiency. Nikia knows what she needs, and feels many roadblocks are in her way. She feels bogged down by the medical system and is looking for alternative solutions that compliment her lifestyle.</p>

Based in patient care and satisfaction, Choice takes every step possible to ensure each patient is being matched with their ideal birth control solution based on health history, insurance coverage, and drug interaction.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Providing the highest level of care means giving patients the freedom to choose their provider based on the preferences that make them most comfortable, be it gender, age, or language.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">With the pill, shot, ring, patch, and emergency contraception pill being delivered directly to the patient's door, women who live in contraception deserts or a busy city-dwelling lifestyle, can trust that Choice will deliver their birth control on-time and at the lowest rate possible.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Lastly, 24-hour support from Choice providers and practitioners gives patients peace of mind that any questions, problems, or emergencies can be addressed in a timely fashion that suits the patients schedule.</p>

				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">The health history section will field Whitney to see if she is a candidate for Choice. Lifestyle habits or current medication make hormonal birth control use incompatible. Whitney will first indicate if she is pregnant or breast-fedding which can make some birth control options more or less effective.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">She will then indicate is she has any menstrual disorders or conditions like excessive menstrual bleeding or polycystic ovary syndrome, as some forms of birth control can control or relieve menstrual disorders. She will decide what her menstrual preference is, as some forms of birth control can elminite the menstrual cycle. Then she will list past or current medical diagnosis and any current medications, so our providers can rule out adverse drug interactions.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">The secondary step in the heath history onboarding focuses on family history and personal disease measures. Choice asks for a family history of cancer, thombious, diabetes and other conditions. Whitney will inform our practitioners if she has a history of blot clots or blood clotting disorders. Lastly Choice needs to screen for smoking behavior as well as getting an up-to-date systolic and diastolic blood pressure reading.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Based on the answers given during the health screening, the patient will either be granted or denied care under Choice. In Whitney’s case, she is granted care and will move onto selecting her provider preferences.</p>

Whitney can indicate the age, gender, education level and primary language spoken by her provider. She will also be able to choose to see a nurse, nurse practitioner, physician's assistant, OB-GYN or medical doctor. She may also indicate a lack of preference for every category except language.</p>

				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">The last step of the onboarding process is to indicate billing and insurance information. If the client has insurance they would input their insurance provider’s name, member name, member number and group number. However, in Whitney’s case she will check the box that she is uninsured. Choice provides generics for all forms of hormonal birth control and emergency contraception, with generics for the shot and ring being brought to market last year. This ensures access to multiple modes of contraception regardless of insurance coverage.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">The billing screen will prompt patients for their credit card provider, credit card number, name on card, expiration date and security code. Shipping can be entered separately if different from billing.</p>
