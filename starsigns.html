		<div class="row">
			<div class="col">
				<h5 class="no-margin">Research</h5>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">The first steps in my research included finding websites that utilized animation, illustration and development in tandem. I was particularly drawn to websites that told stories and used illustration assets to support a narrative. I was less drawn to commercial or retail websites.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Wanting to focus on something effervescent, I brainstormed what content would allow me to complete this website given the abbreviated timeframe. I have always had an interest in zodiac signs, and I saw a great opportunity to my foster my illustration skills by drawing humans and animals. With my web direction and content solidified, the next phase was bringing my ideas to life.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col">
				<h5 class="no-margin-1">Animation and Illustration:</h5>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">The animation and illustration process was not a linear learning experience. I started to express ideas in illustrator, and began to iron out what shapes, colors, and illustration style I would use. I began drawing circles with different stroke weights and landed on a series of orbits that would act as secondary elements. I chose colors that were reminiscent of the night sky, and used a mythical typeface as my primary type to lean into the mysticism and magic around the zodiac.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Once I had my layout solved, I began to illustrate Aries, the ram. I spent more time in the beginning stages of illustration, figuring out which illustration style would be most efficient during the animation process. I landed on stroke illustrations that would could let the stars from the background of the site move through the illustrations. After I had successfully drawn Aries, and the associated zodiac symbol, I exported the file and brought it into After Effects.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">In After Effects, I converted my artwork using trim paths to have access to every stroke path from the illustrations. Using keyframes, I began to animate the paths individually at varying times. This was the part of the process that took the longest, as I was still new to After Effects. By repeating the process from above I was able to illustrate and animate in a quarter of the time as I worked my way through the zodiac. Once I was at Leo, I had the process down pat.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col">
				<h5 class="no-margin-1">Development:</h5>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Now that all my design assets were built and exported in a JSON data format, I began to code the project. I began with creating partials for each of the 12 signs, and using JavaScript, created a slider for them to live in. Using CSS I made all my animations display on the page properly, and I set timing and looping parameters inside the lottie.js loadAnimation() object.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Once my animations and particles.js library were rendering in the bowser, and my slider was functional, I began to code the remaining pages. I created an introductory page that introduced the project, a navigation page to easily locate each zodiac sign, and an about page, that describes the project, the parameters, skill set, and tools used. Lastly I deployed the site using GitHub Pages. </p>

			<div class="col">
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Ultimately the project goals were met, as I created a website that integrated current web technologies, animation, and illustration into a single website that serves to delight users while they learn about their zodiac sign.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Creating a website that is functional and visually unique appeals to people who are interested in the zodiac and also individuals who appreciate dynamic web technology. Living in a time where technology and art can so seamlessly intertwine is a privilege and I believe this project highlights that relationship.</p>

				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">My solution for illustration and visual design was inspired by planetary orbits and the night sky. Primary shapes include circles to represent how the solar system rotates cyclicially. Dark blues and cream emulate the night sky, and light brown serves to soften the color pallet. I chose line drawings as my primary illustration style because it complemented the single stroke style of the orbits, and I found single stroke illustrations animate in a complex and interesting way.</p>

				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">The animation phase of the website was a multistep process. Taking illustrations from Illustrator, I brought them into After Effects and transformed them into shapes I could animate using keyframes. One of the surprising findings from this stage in the process was how important timing is in animation. I chose simple animations because my illustrations have many details. I also stayed away from large complex animation techniques as I wanted to keep the illustrations flat and in a 2-D space.  The animated assets in this project breathe life into the website, and create a unique viewing experience for the user. </p>

				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">The coding phase of this project was enjoyable as I was able to integrate previous knowledge in front-end development and incorporate this knowledge with the Bodymovin plugin and lottie.js library. The Bodymovin plugin is an open source plugin that allows the designer/developer to export animations from After Effects in a JSON data format that lottie.js reads. Coded in JavaScript, lottie.js allows the developer control over an object with parameters such as looping and autoplay.</p>
