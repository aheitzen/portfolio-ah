Designers primary responsibility was to provide responsive mockups and prototypes to the development team. The aforementioned designers solved problems around navigation, tone, look and feel, and prototyped all five pages of the site at multiple screen sizes. Their hard work allowed the development team to code quickly and efficiently as many design problems had already been solved.</p>

The development team needed to overcome some mass hurdled this project, from broken plugins to information gaps, but through the challenges we learnt new technologies and strengthened our source control and development toolkits. All developers also provided input on design comps through the lens of usability and accessibility.</p>

				<h5 class="no-margin-1">Project management</h5>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">The first step in the project was to define a system where we could all communicate effectively with each other. We utilized Slack, Trello, printed calendars, and weekly meetings to stay up-to-date on progress as well as pain points. I created the Trello board, calendar, pinterest boards, and lead the weekly meetings.It was also my responsibility to distill key takeaways from lead meetings, smaller meetings with the leads of each team.</p>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col">
				<h5 class="no-margin-1">Divide and Conquer</h5>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Now that the team had means to communicate effectively it was time to divide the work. I decided to divide the team of six into two groups of three, three designers and three developers. Feedback would cross that distinction as we all have skills in design, but modularizing the group into smaller teams proved effective in dividing and expediting work.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">The design team began to work on lo-fi prototypes of the web pages, while the development team sourced for innovative web technologies around movement. I began to plan out the site architecture and familiarize myself with the WordPress environment.</p>

Main final design changes included changing the layout of the single student grid page as well as limiting how much information is displayed in the side navigation on given pages.

				<h5 class="no-margin-1">Form Building</h5>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">During the above mentioned process, I began building a submission form for the website. Using a WordPress plugin called Advanced Custom Fields, I was able to connect form data to the webpage. While building the form, I was limited by WordPress UI, which can be confusing and is not user-friendly. I put emphasis on usability and annotated every input field, and used language that was easily digestible.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">In addition to providing scaffolding via captions, I also created a form submission document where all information relating to saving images for web and uploading content to the site successfully could be found. Throughout this process, I learned that clear communication and documentation can solve many individuals common pain points.</p>

				<h5 class="no-margin-1">Responsive web development</h5>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Building the website involved many revisions and pivots. Initially we believed we could use CSS grid and flexbox as the primary grid system when populating the pages with student submissions. We quickly ran into trouble when introducing logic into that paradigm. CSS grid and flexbox worked very well on certain pages, where we had more control over student submissions, dimensions, and overall layout, but on the homepage specifically the logic and layout were not playing nicely.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">These pain points ultimately lead to simplifying two pages of the site, the homepage and single student post page. Instead of working with the full funky power of CSS grid, I went back to basics and simplified layout and solidified image upload dimensions.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Once I had content from the form successfully rendering in the browser, I began to code using html and css to perfect the layout, and added JavaScript where necessary, such as the search and filter functionality, and other small interaction patterns like scrolling to a named anchor point, and hover functionality in the navbar. Finding the PHP syntax and attributes I needed, I referenced the WordPress codex, and referenced Stack Overflow for other WordPress/PHP questions.</p>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col">
				<h5 class="no-margin-1">Quality control</h5>
				<p class="projects-paragraph-black">Now that the website was successfully being populated by student work from form submissions, it was time to make sure the uploads were successful. Due to various problems with the ACF plugin, I was unable to put the correct constraints on image uploads, leading to inconsistent images sizes. Other inconsistencies from data included forgetting to fill in certain lines, and misspellings. Sean and Ian ran quality control on the site, and documented these minor mistakes. They then approached the individuals to close the issue, to ultimately give the site the polish and cohesion we were striving for.</p>

				<p class="projects-paragraph">Building the website for the class of 2019 graduation was a great honor and joy. Being able to preserve and achieve our legacy for ourselves, faculty, and future students felt more impactful and necessary than offering information on the Portshowlio event.

				<p class="projects-paragraph">The homepage offered the biggest opportunities for solidifying our grid system. One of the biggest lessons learned from this portion of the site, was when working with large user submissions, keeping the layout simple is the best solution. From a technical standpoint and design standpoint, I think for a site like this, letting the work speak for itself and providing the container for it to shine, is more important than showing off trendy or new layouts made possible by CSS grid.</p>
				<p class="projects-paragraph">More generally, the homepage is the first page the user sees when navigating to the site. Featured images are shown from each student, and when you hover over the work, the students headshot and name is revealed in the side-navigation. We wanted to create a direct link between the work and the students headshot and name, creating stronger connections between the work and the designer.</p>
